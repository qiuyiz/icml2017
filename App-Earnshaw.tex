\section{Earnshaw's Theorem}

\earnshaw*
\begin{proof}
  If $(\boldsymbol{a,\theta})$ is a differentiable strict local
  minima, then for any $i,$ we must have
\[\nabla_{\theta_{i}} L = 0, \text{ and }  \Tr(\nabla^2_{\theta_i}L) > 0.\]
Since $\Phi$ is harmonic, we also have
\begin{align*}
&  \Tr(\nabla^2_{\theta_i}L(\theta_1,...,\theta_n)) = \Delta_{\theta_i} L \\
&  =  2\sum_{ j\neq i} a_ia_j \Delta_{\theta_i}\Phi(\theta_i,\theta_j)
  + 2\sum_{j=1}^ka_ib_j  \Delta_{\theta_i}\Phi(\theta_i,w_j) = 0,
\end{align*}
which is a contradiction. In the first line, there is a factor of 2 by symmetry.
\end{proof}
